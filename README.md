This is a base framework implementation for federated learning.

## Features

- This framework serves as a simulator for a single computer to run federated learning.
- Only 1 GPU training is supported now.
- This framework is easy to extend.

## Quick Start

- Use a single command to start the training process.

  python run.py
  ```

- To change configs, you can both write a arg-file and use the command line. A template for arg-file can be seen at 'args/test_arg.py'
